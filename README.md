Re-writing of an original printf function [printf](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_printf.htm), a lighter version. Not every code was created, just these:

```
%c Prints a single character.
%s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
%p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
%d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
%i Prints an integer in base 10.
%u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
%x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
%X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
%% Prints a percent sign.
```
